This project creates plots of interesting dynamical systems.
Examples:
2D brownian motion
3D brownian motion
fractal generator(s)
bouncing ball in gravity
colliding balls, inelastic
Solomon/Fogleman tracer and phase plot
Forced/Damped system


Control flow:
Executor requests that a specific module runs and listens to end or switch
if switch bounce to new module
if end clean up and close

Need to decide that either each module owns its own plotting 
or they all plug into a common interface

Need to find/pick a plotter (could just print to file for now)
